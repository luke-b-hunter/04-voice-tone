# Chapter IV.

All my life I tried to avoid copying as much as possible. From my experience copying was viewed as something negative: "Do you copy? You're a stealer!"  When I was little, copying was called *monkeying* in our Czech elementary school, that meant if you were copying something from somebody else, you were a *copymonkey*, so like a copycat in English, but with monkeys instead! Your schoolmates would publicly shame you for copying. In our class copying was simply a *taboo*.

But what if you liked the stuff you saw your classmate do? I would get jealous easily and try to implement something that I liked from his work into mine to make my work look better. Basically, I tried to copy other peoples ideas in a very subtle way so nobody would notice. I would just tweak something in my work to make it look a little better. But was it really copying? What is the boundary between copying and inspiration?

To many, it's a matter of personal opinion, but when somebody is really proud of their work, they get angry if someone copies even just a tiny thing from their work. But maybe we shouldn't see copying in a negative light. After all, seeing somebody being inspired by your work, can mean that they really like your work. When you get older, you learn to acknowledge the masters people before you, for example the old masters in art. Many artists were inspired by their previous peers like Vincent van Gogh who liked Baroque Dutch masters and Japanese paintings. Japanese art was seen as something new and hip in 19th century Europe and inspired Van Gogh in many ways. He liked to copy works from the Japanese master Hiroshige to further his style.
